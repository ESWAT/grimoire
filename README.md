> A journaling webapp with lite RPG mechanics

This is an ongoing experiment in combining the habit of journaling with game mechanics. Also an exercise in finding an efficient ES6 front-end stack for quick prototyping/MVPing.

Key technologies:

- _React_ for view rendering
- _MobX_ for state management
- _React Router_ for client-side routing
- _webpack_ for JavaScript module bundling
- _Dexie_ for offline storage
- _Babel_ for ES6/7 transpiling
